# BikeRental_Demand_prediction
A machine learning project for analyzing and predicting bike rental demand using EDA, data preprocessing, and model building techniques.

**Dataset** : Contains bike rental records with features such as season, weather, temperature, humidity, and rental count (target).

**Steps of Project**:
  - Basic checks and EDA
  - Data preprocessing (outliers handling, encoding, scaling, train-test-split)
  - Model building and evaluation
  - Model selection
  - Final report and conclusion

**Result** : XGBoost perfroms well with 0.88% accuracy.

**How to Run** : using Git Clone method..
  - Copy the repository URL from GitHub.
  - Open Command Prompt (CMD).
  - Clone the repository using: git clone "copied url".
  - Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the cloned folder.
  - Open the .ipynb file and run cells step by step.
